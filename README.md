![](.gitbook/assets/hyperledger_fabric_logo_color.png)

* Learn the basics of fabric architecture by setting up a fabric business network
* Write a smart contract and deploy it onto business network
* Write a fabric client app to invoke smart client 

## Prerequisites

* Familiarity with fabric [key concepts](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.0/key_concepts.html) and [transaction flow](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.0/txflow.html?highlight=transaction%20flow)
* Golang
* Docker
* Bash

## Background

I have a fair amount of experience in writing software and leading software development teams. One of the joys of being a software developer is getting to learn new ways of working with different tech. [Hyperledger Fabric](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric) is one such very exciting project in the subject of enterprise distributed ledger technology.

This gitbook is an attempt to  make an easy entry into this field by creating a project from scratch  with the minimum amount of concepts and  setup involved \(atleast this approach worked for me\). After creating this simple project the reader will have enough confidence to go into in depth study of the subcomponents of Fabric.

{% hint style="info" %}
I must appreciate the comprehensive documentation provided by Fabric team at -[https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/) . It's an absolute joy to read\(which is rarer than a unicorn in software documentation\).This gitbook is a simplified and hands-on view of the essential materials in the fabric documentation and the [Fabric Samples](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples) repo.
