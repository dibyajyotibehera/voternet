## Background

I have a fair amount of experience in writing software and leading software development teams. One of the joys of being a software developer is getting to learn new ways of working with different tech. [Hyperledger Fabric](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric) is one such very exciting project in the subject of enterprise distributed ledger technology.

This gitbook is an attempt to make an easy entry into this field by creating a project from scratch with the minimum amount of concepts and setup involved (atleast this approach worked for me). After creating this simple project the reader will have enough confidence to go into in depth study of the subcomponents of Fabric.

I must appreciate the comprehensive documentation provided by Fabric team at -[https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io) . It's an absolute joy to read.This gitbook is a simplified and hands-on view of the essential materials in the fabric documentation and the [Fabric Samples](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples) repo
